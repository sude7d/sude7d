<p align="center">
-🎓 I am an Industrial Engineer graduated from Balıkesir University with a GPA of 3.24.  
-🚗 I am interested in production, process improvement,robotic coding and software.  
-📈 I work on production planning models, optimization, lean manufacturing and data analysis.
## 📘 Graduation Project Details

The implementation consists of two stages: **demand forecasting** and **production scheduling**.

### **🔹 Stage 1: Demand Forecasting**
- Historical sales data were analyzed using multiple forecasting methods.
- The methods were compared, and the most suitable one was selected.
- The resulting demand forecasts were used as inputs for the optimization stage.

### **🔹 Stage 2: Production Scheduling & Cost Minimization**
- The objective was to minimize production costs and holding (inventory) costs.
- Constraints such as:
  - Machine and oven capacities,
  - Machine-product compatibility,
  - Restrictions on simultaneous production  
  were taken into account.
- Four separate mathematical optimization models were developed for four different product groups.
- All models were implemented and solved using the **GAMS** solver.
